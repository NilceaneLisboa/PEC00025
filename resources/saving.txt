## 1. Introduction <a name="section_1"></a> 

Whenever a function $f(t)$ is defined by means of a differential equation 
and a suitable set of boundary conditions, it may be convenient to 
transform the problem of finding $f(t)$, a function of an independent
variable $t$ (time), into a new problem of finding $\bar{f}(s)$, function 
of a transformed independent variable $s$ (complex frequency). 
This linear operation may be generically expressed as:

$$\bar{f}(s) = \int_{a}^{b} K(s,t) \; f(t) \; dt $$

where the function $K(s,t)$ is called _transform kernel_.
If the integral limits $a$ and $b$ are finites, the function 
$\bar{f}(s)$ is a _finite transformation_.
Among many possibilities, we shall study the two most important kernels 
in our context of vibration analysis, namely the _Laplace_ and the 
_Fourier_ transforms.
These transforms feature the possibility of being reversed in a unique
way and can be used to find solutions of linear systems (differential
equations) both algebraically or numerically.

In the particular case of _Laplace Transform_, we are concerned with the
time domain solutions of the dynamic equilibrium equation for some 
special loading functions, such as the _unit impulse_ and the _unit step_ 
functions, which are of fundamental importance for understanding the
dynamic behavior of structural systems.




## 2. Formal definition  <a name="section_2"></a> 

Let $f(t)$ be a real function defined for all $t > 0$. 
The _Laplace Transform_ of $f(t)$ is defined as:

$$ \mathcal{L}\left\{ f(t) \right\} = \bar{f}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st}\; f(t) \; dt $$

The transform kernel in this case is

$$  K(s,t) = e^{-st} $$

with $s$ being a complex frequency $s = \sigma + i\omega$, with units in 
radians per second for $t$ in seconds.
Observing that one of the integral bounds is infinite, the function $f(t)$ 
must fulfill some special conditions such that the integral convergence
can be ensured.
For instance, the function $f(t)$ must have a finite number of finite 
descontinuities and no infinite descontinuity (be piecewise continuous) 
along the integration interval.
We will not give further details about these conditions, for there will be
no issues regarding the functions we will be addressing here.

Although the Laplace transform can be reversed in a unique way, its inverse form
cannot be expressed as simply as the direct transform. 
The transform of a given function and its inverse constitutes a so-called
_transform pair_, usually represented as:

$$ \mathcal{L}\left\{ f(t) \right\} \Longleftrightarrow \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ f(s) \right\} $$

The most straightforward way of using Laplace transforms is by means of _lookup tables_.
However, some fundamental functions must receive special attention as follows.

### 3.1. Unit step (Heaviside's) function <a name="section_31"></a> 

The _unit step_, also known as _Heaviside's function_, is defined as 

$$ H(t-a) = \left\{ 
            \begin{array}{ll}
             0 & t < a \\
             1 & t > a
            \end{array} 
            \right . $$

and is depicted in the figure below (for $a = 0$): 

<img src="images/heaviside.png" alt="Heaviside" width="640px"/>

By applying the Laplace transform to this function it results:

$$ \mathcal{L}\left\{ H(t-a) \right\} = \bar{H}(s) = \int_{a}^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot 1 \cdot dt $$

and hence:

$$ \bar{H}(s) = \frac {e^{-as}}{s} $$

For the particular case where the discontinuity occurs for $t = 0$, with $a = 0$:

$$ \bar{H}(s) = \frac{1}{s} $$

The Heaviside's function usually represents a sudden change in a otherwise static load, 
which may cause some significant dynamic response.
